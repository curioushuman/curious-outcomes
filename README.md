## Things that need to be outlined

- OpenAPI file
  - In separate files
    - Inc. link
  - Drawn together during build
- Talk about the multi-stage build process
  - TODO: would be nice to use Nx a bit more for this
    - so we can skip cached bits
- CDK setup
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html
    - Bootstrapping
      - cdk bootstrap aws://793735516609/ap-southeast-2
    - See if you can get some of this into a setup script
